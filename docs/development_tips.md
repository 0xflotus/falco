## How to add a package to Django

If you need to add a Django package in FALCO backend, please use folowing procedure:

- Go to `falco` directory

- Launch backend:
    ```sh
    make backend/start
    ```

- Once backend is completely up, install your package inside docker:
    ```sh
    docker exec -it falco_backend_1 pipenv install <package_name>==<package_version>
    ```
    *This will install your package, then update Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files accordingly.*

- Once package is installed, stop backend using `Ctrl + C`

- To make your package installation persistent, you have to rebuild all Django containers:
    ```sh
    docker-compose build --no-cache backend

    docker-compose build --no-cache celeryworker

    docker-compose build --no-cache celerybeat
    ```
- Relaunch backend and ensure you have no error:
    ```sh
    make backend/start
    ```
- Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
