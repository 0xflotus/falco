# Outboarding

When leaving the project, there are a couple of steps that you must follow in order to ensure the security of the project.

## Remove projects rights on prod and staging
Go on each project of which you are either member or admin and remove yourself from those projects

## Remove admin rights on prod and staging
Another admin must edit your profile and remove, both on prod and staging
- your staff status
- your superuser status
- any other right in the dedicated section (user rights)

## Delete your local version of the database
Your local version of the database may contain sensitive information, and therefore must be deleted.
In order to do this, open Datagrip and right-click on the local database name, then click on 'drop'.

## Remove all the database dumps
Check all the database dumps that you may have on your computer. Check the Downloads folder.

## Get removed from the Trello Board
Ask another member to remove you from the trello board.

## Get removed from scrumble
Ask another member of the scrumble board to remove you from the project.

## Leave all the WhatsApp groups
Time to say goodbye :'(
